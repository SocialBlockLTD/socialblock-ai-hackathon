## üß≠ Hackathon Tracks

Pick your path or blaze a new one:

### 1. üß† AI Reputation Agents  
Design agents that analyze, score, and evolve user/validator reputation based on behavior, interactions, or on-chain actions.

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è zk-AI for Privacy  
Use zkML or zero-knowledge proof systems to validate off-chain AI outputs (e.g. moderation, scores, signal) without revealing data.

### 3. ü™Ñ AI x Governance  
Create AI copilots for DAOs: proposal summarizers, voting agents, consensus visualizers, or signal-boosters.

### 4. üîç On-Chain Moderation  
Train and deploy AI moderators that filter spam, scams, or sybil attacks in SocialBlock or integrated community tools.

### 5. üß∞ Dev Tooling & SDKs  
Build open SDKs, APIs, or CLI tools that enable AI integration into the SocialBlock ecosystem or dApps.
